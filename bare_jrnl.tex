% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
In virtualized cloud environments, meeting the network bandwidth requirements of virtual machines (VMs) is challenging due to the lack of accurate methods for translating target network bandwidth into precise CPU allocations.
This translation is non-trivial, as outcomes vary depending on factors such as workloads, message sizes, and hardware configurations.
For instance, our experiments reveal that for the same CPU allocation, network bandwidth can vary between $0.4\times$ and $3.5\times$.
In this paper, we introduce \name, a machine learning (ML) framework for network bandwidth to CPU translations. \name predicts ``appropriate'' CPU budgets for new workloads to meet their bandwidth requirements.
We demonstrate that \name completes data collection and training in ${\sim}16$ minutes while achieving target bandwidth accurately with ${\sim}6.5\times$ less CPU utilization compared to existing schemes. Our experiments also confirm that \name is effective across diverse workloads, message sizes, and hardware configurations.
